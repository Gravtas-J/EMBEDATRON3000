# EMBEDATRON3000
EMBEDATRON3000 is a Streamlit application that allows you to upload PDF files, processes the text within them, splits the text into manageable chunks, embeds those chunks using OpenAI's embeddings, and then stores these embeddings in a FAISS vector store. The generated vector store is then serialized and saved to disk for future use.
